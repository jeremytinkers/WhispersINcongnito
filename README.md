Modeled off the popular chinese whisper app where users can share their cumbering secrets anonymously. 

A project-for-learning where I implemented 6 differing levels of Authentication in increasing order from basic user login to encryption to md5 hashing to bcrypt to Cookies/Session and to finally OAuth2 with Passport.js 
(Committed at each wrung of production and hence code for required level can be viewed by simply navigating to the desired version)

Future Goals: 1) Include Oauth2 for Facebook and Instagram signups. 2) Remodel website to an ask anonymous platform where users can ask questions without being judged. An answer section will have to be added to.
